============

== December 8, 2014 ===========================================================
- manually compiled git to newest version to allow aout-sign of commits
- moved NOTES from 'qubes-builder' here
- configured thunderbird better for displaying reply emails
- moved 'depends.sh' from core-admin to here

- git installation from source notes:
  - git-key:

    Fingerprint=96E0 7AF2 5771 9559 80DA  D100 20D0 4E5A 7136 60A7

  - git install steps:
    git clone https://github.com/git/git.git
    cd git
    git fetch
    git checkout v2.2.0
    git verify-tag v2.2.0
    #yum erase git  # No point in removing existing git if you want kdevelop* + perl-Git
    make configure
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make all doc
    sudo make install install-doc install-html; # as root
    sudo yum install kdevelop kdevelop-libs perl-Git; # Were removed as depends to git

  - Opps, kdevelop kdevelop-libs perl-Git require git as depend, so I guess re-install
    old git package again, and re-run 'make install...' again to over-write git

  - NOTE: Will need to 'make-install' again on any git repo update though


== December 5-7, 2014 =========================================================
- created a dedicated devlop environment for Qubes work
- created dedicated Qubes OS signing key
- created repo on github
- created a WIP branch of qubes-builder (nrgaway) to pull proper branches / repos

- created a script to install develop dependencies for python and track missing spec depends
- able to get doc to compile and read though them

- Should I create copy of all repos on github
- How to sign (tag) -- manually or via Makefile?
- How to add a git remote (your branch to my branch)

- line length 80 or 132?  
- pep8; pylint; travis-ci

I have reviewed the docs and test, noticing only init and vm tests are currently implemented so far.  Most of the code still seems foreign to me at this point so I guess I should just dive in and start something to become more familiar on how it all works together.

Do you just want me to start proof reading the code correcting spelling mistakes, remove unused imports, etc?
