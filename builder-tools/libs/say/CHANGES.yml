  version: 1.4.2
  date: September 15, 2015
  notes: >
    Tested with Python 3.5.0 final.

-
  version: 1.4.0
  date: September 8, 2015
  notes: >
    Added ability to set styles for some methods such as ``title``, ``hr``,
    and ``sep`` as an overlay to class, object, and per-call settings.
    This is a first delivery on what will become a general feature over
    the next few releases. Added vertical spacing to ``title`` and ``sep``
    methods for nicer layouts.
    
    Increased testing line coverage to 96%, improving several routines'
    robustness in the process.

  notes: Code cleanups.
  version: 1.3.2

-
  date: August 11, 2015
  notes: 'Doc, config, and testing updates. Removed ``joiner`` module and tests. May
    import that funcationality from ``quoter`` module in future.

    Python 2.6 currently unsupported due to issues with underlying ``stuf`` module.
    Support may return, depending on compatibility upgrades for future ``stuf`` releases.'
  version: 1.3.1

-
  date: July 22, 2015
  notes: Added ``Template`` class. A deferred-rendering version of ``Text``
  version: '1.3'

-
  date: July 22, 2015
  notes: Configuration, testing matrix, and doc tweaks.
  version: 1.2.6

-
  date: December 29, 2014
  notes: Fixed problem that was occuring with use of Unicode characters when rendered
    inside the Komodo IDE, which set the ``sys.stdout`` encoding to ``US-ASCII`` not
    ``UTF-8``. In those cases, now inserts a codec-based writer object to do the encoding.
  version: 1.2.5

-
  date: June 4, 2014
  notes: 'Now testing for Python 3.3 and 3.4. One slight problem with them when encoding
    to base64 or similar bytes-oriented output that did not appear in earlier Python
    3 builds. Examining.

    Added gittip link as an experiment.'
  version: 1.2.4

-
  date: October 16, 2013
  notes: 'Fixed bug with quoting of style names/definitions.

    Tweaked documentation of style definitions.'
  version: 1.2.1

-
  date: September 30, 2013
  notes: Added style definitions and convenient access to ANSI colors.
  version: 1.2.0

-
  date: September 24, 2013
  notes: 'Line numbering now an optional way to format output.

    Line wrapping is now much more precise. The ``wrap`` parameter now specifies the
    line length desired, including however many characters are consumed by prefix,
    suffix, and indentation.

    Vertical spacing is regularized and much better tested. The ``vsep`` option, previously
    available only on a few methods, is now available everywhere. ``vsep=N`` gives
    N blank lines before and after the given output statement. ``vsep=(M,N)`` gives
    M blank lines before, and N blank lines after. A new ``Vertical`` class describes
    vertical spacing behind the scenes.

    ``Say`` no longer attempts to handle file encoding itself, but passes this responsibility
    off to file objects, such as those returned by ``io.open``. This is cleaner, though
    it does remove the whimsical possibility of automagical base64 and rot13 encodings.
    The ``encoding`` option is withdrawn as a result.

    You can now set the files you''d like to output to in the same way you''d set
    any other option (e.g. ``say.set(files=[...])`` or ``say.clone(files=[...])``).
    "Magic" parameter handling is enabled so that if any of the items listed are strings,
    then a file of that name is opened for writing. Beware, however, that if you manage
    the files option explicitly (e.g. ``say.options.files.append(...)``), you had
    better provide proper open files. No magical interpretation is done then. The
    previously-necessary ``say.setfiles()`` API remains, but is now deprecated.

    ``fmt()`` is now handled by ``Fmt``, a proper subclass of ``Say``, rather than
    just through instance settings.

    ``say()`` no longer returns the value it outputs. ``retvalue`` and ``encoded``
    options have therefore been withdrawn.'
  version: 1.1.0

-
  date: September 16, 2013
  notes: Had to back out part of the common ``__version__`` grabbing. Not compatible
    with Sphinx / readthedocs build process.
  version: 1.0.4

-
  date: September 16, 2013
  notes: 'Added ``FmtException`` class

    Tightened imports for namespace cleanliness.

    Doc tweaks.

    Added ``__version__`` metadata common to module, ``setup.py``, and docs.'
  version: 1.0.3

-
  date: September 14, 2013
  notes: Added ``prefix`` and ``suffix`` options to ``say`` and ``fmt``, along with
    docs and tests.
  version: 1.0.2

-
  date: September 13, 2013

    documentation on readthedocs.org. ``README.rst`` now an abridged version/teaser
    for the module.

-
  date: September 2013
  notes: 'Cleaned up source for better PEP8 conformance

    Bumped version number to 1.0 as part of move to `semantic versioning <http://semver.org>`_,
    or at least enough of it so as to not screw up Python installation procedures
    (which don''t seem to understand 0.401 is a lesser version that 0.5, because 401
    > 5).'
  version: '1.0'
